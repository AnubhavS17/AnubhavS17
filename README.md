<em>Tip:</em>  
Markdown on GitHub does not support custom font sizes or colors natively. The HTML `<span>` tags above work in some Markdown renderers (like on GitHub Pages or some viewers), but not in the default GitHub README view.  
To ensure best compatibility, use headings (`#`, `##`, etc.) and **bold** or *italic* text for emphasis.
